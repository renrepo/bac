Anfrage Amptek 19.03.2018
Hello,
our research group is interested in a new amplifier for a (Xray/ultraviolet) photoelectron spectrometer. 
We're using a CEM (Photonis X919VL) at ~3000V anode voltage which is connected via a high voltage decoupling capacitor 
to the input pin of the amplifier. Downstream of the amplifier a counting unit is installed to count 
incoming photoelectrons. At peaks the counting rate reaches up to ~1e6 cps.
Since the currently used amplifier is about 30 years old and no longer working well we need to replace it.
Can you submit me an offer? How long are your delivery times? As far as I can see, the charge sensitive 
preamplifier & discriminator A121 (together with the PC121 test board) will meet our requirements.

Thanks in advance and best regards from Germany,

Rene Wabnitz
